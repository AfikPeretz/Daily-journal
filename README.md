# Daily-journal
In this project I built a web application that is used for a daily journal, for this I used the following technologies:
1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. Ejs
4. Lodash
5. Body-parser

To run the project with you, of course, you will have to download the modules I mentioned.
Then run the app.js file with node and open the address "http://localhost:3000/" in the browser and from there, I'll leave it to you to enjoy :)
